A Bmi Calculator 

## Getting Started

When the user inputs their height and weight, the app would perform a simple calculation to determine their BMI, which is a measure of body fat based on height and weight. The formula for calculating BMI is weight (in kilograms) divided by height (in meters) squared.

## The app could display the user's BMI along with an explanation of what their BMI means in terms of their overall health
